Problem
Check if a binary tree is symmetric (mirror image of itself around its center).
Approach
Use recursive comparison of the tree's left and right subtrees.
Key Ideas
1. Base Cases

Empty tree is symmetric
Compare left and right subtrees of the root

2. Recursive Comparison
For two nodes to be mirrors of each other:

Both are None: symmetric ✓
One is None, other isn't: not symmetric ✗
Both exist but values differ: not symmetric ✗
Both exist with same values: recursively check:

Outside pair: left.left vs right.right
Inside pair: left.right vs right.left



3. Symmetry Condition
The tree is symmetric if both the outside and inside pairs are symmetric.
Algorithm
isSymmetric(root):
    if root is None: return True
    return compare(root.left, root.right)

compare(left, right):
    if both None: return True
    if only one None: return False
    if values differ: return False
    
    return compare(left.left, right.right) AND 
           compare(left.right, right.left)
Complexity

Time: O(n) - visit each node once
Space: O(h) - recursion stack depth (h = height of tree)

Example

Symmetric: left subtree (2,3,4) mirrors right subtree (2,4,3) ✓
